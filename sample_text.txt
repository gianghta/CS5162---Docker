How can it? O! how can Loves eye be true,
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail;
And fortify your self in your decay
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why

Nor double penance, to correct correction.
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons quality;
With what I most enjoy contented least;

If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

And on just proof surmise accumulate;
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
