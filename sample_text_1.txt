Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
But if thou live, remembered not to be,
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,

That you are you, so dignifies his story.
And saved my life, saying not you.
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,

May still seem love to me, though altered new;
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
To every hymn that able spirit affords,
But that, so much of earth and water wrought,

In days long since, before these last so bad.
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,

By oft predict that I in heaven find:
For it no form delivers to the heart
Towards thee Ill run, and give him leave to go.
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,

And life no longer than thy love will stay,
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments

For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
Unless this general evil they maintain,
When that mine eye is famishd for a look,
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.

Although our undivided loves are one:
Than when it hath my added praise beside!
